# Mod5Proj-MC
Module 5 Project
This is a maintenance task on the previous project Module 4.
The following project takes the linked list project and adapts it to 
work as a Stack.
The stack functions similar to the linked list format, the program takes a users input and asks for how many elements are to be added to the stack.
After gathering the total number of elements to be added, the program asks for each individual element and then adds them to the stack.
After all the elements are added to the stack, the stack is sorted in ascending order.
