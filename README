# How to run/compile the project files
# Program information:
This is a maintenance task, the overall project was tasked to be changed from a linked list implementation
to a Stack implementation. The functionality is still similar to the linked list as in the user defines the number of elements
to be added to the stack and then determines what that values are to be as well. Areas of the program that were changed are marked by a comment.

## Running the Project
Navigate to the folder on the command line; Project name is ETMod5Proj5 or the name you give it.
Once in the project folder navigate into the source directory, src folder.
Then in the src folder, run the java compiler command on the NumList file first.
\> ETMod5Proj5 > src javac NumStack.java
Then run the java compiler command on the Main file.
\> ETMod5Proj5 > src javac Main.java
Once both files have been compiled, run the Main file.
\> ETMod5Proj5 > src java Main
code will execute 

### Running JavaDocs
Navigate to the folder on the command line; Project name is ETMod4Proj4.
Once in the project folder navigate into the source directory, src folder.
Then in the src folder, run the java docs command on the NumList file first.
\> ETMod5Proj5 > src javadoc -d bin NumStack.java
Files will generate the java documentation.
Then run the java docs command on the Main file.
\> ETMod5Proj5 > src javadoc -d bin Main.java
Files will generate the java documentation.
